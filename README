Using cowerpoint to write your own presentation
-----------------------------------------------

1) Clone powerpoint:
	git clone git@github.com:minego/cowerpoint.git

1a) Or, if you're putting your presentation in a git repo, add cowerpoint as
a submodule:
	git submodule add git@github.com:minego/cowerpoint.git cowerpoint
	git submodule update --init --recursive

2) Copy the template files from cowerpoint:
	cp cowerpoint/template/* .

3) Open index.html in an editor, find the "slides" container, and replace our
silly example slides with your own brilliant inspiring and beautiful slides.

4) If you only need to view cowerpoint locally (no remote) then simply open your
new index.html in a browser and you're done.



If you want a remote, and want to allow others to follow along in their
browser then you're not done.

5) Open config.json in an editor and change the password. This password will be
required to connect the remote.

6) Start the server by running:
	npm update
	node .

8) Then present it at:
	http://{your computer}:1234

9) And control it from another device at:
	http://{your computer}:1234/remote/


You may view the presentation from multiple laptops, tablets, phones, etc at the
same time. The remote will keep them all in sync.
