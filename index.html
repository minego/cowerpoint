					Hide the tedium of slide presentations in the comfort and
					safety of your favorite browser.

				<p>
					This is cowerpoint. It is meant to be a very simple way to
					create presentations because your boss insists that you talk
					in front of people.
				</p>

				<p>
					Click anywhere to go to the next slide.
				</p>

				<h3>Hey, another slide!</h3>

				<p>You can also use the arrow keys to go between slides</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Really getting up to speed now</h3>

				<p>Right click takes you back</p>

			<div class="instant">
				<h3>Easy to edit</h3>

				<p>
					Just add a div for each slide. Add your own CSS to make it
					pretty (or don't).
				</p>

				<p>
					Give a div <strong>class="instant"</strong> to have it
					skip the animated transition.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Thanks</h3>

				<p>That's really about it.</p>
