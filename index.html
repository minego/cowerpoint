					This is cowerpoint. It is meant to be a very simple way to
					create presentations because your boss insists that you talk
					in front of people.

					Click anywhere to go to the next slide.

				<h3>Easy to edit</h3>

				<p>
					Just add a div for each slide. Add your own CSS to make it
					pretty (or don't).
				</p>

				<p>
					Give a div <strong>class="instant"</strong> to have it
					skip the animated transition.
